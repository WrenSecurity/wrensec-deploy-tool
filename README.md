# Wren Deploy
A swiss-army command-line tool for managing, compiling, and publishing multiple
versions of a Maven package and then deploying them to BinTray or JFrog.

Usage: `wren-deploy.sh <COMMAND> [--with-provider=PROVIDER]`

Where `COMMAND` can be any of the following:
  - `create-sustaining-branches`  
    Creates `sustaining/X.Y.Z` branches in the current package from all release
    tags in the package.

  - `delete-sustaining-branches`  
    Deletes all `sustaining/X.Y.Z` branches from the current package.

  - `patch-all-releases [SRC-REF] [STARTING-RELEASE-TAG]`  
    Cherry-picks either `HEAD` or `SRC-REF` on to all release branches, 
    optionally targeting only the release identified by the specified 
    `STARTING-RELEASE-TAG` and later releases (typically to resume a cherry pick 
    after fixing conflicts).

  - `compile-all-releases`  
    Sequentially checks out each release of the current package and compiles it.

  - `compile-current-release`  
    Compiles whatever version of the current package is checked out.

  - `deploy-all-releases`  
    Sequentially checks out each release of the current package, compiles it, 
    signs it, and then deploys it to a provider.

  - `deploy-current-release`  
    Compiles whatever version of the current package is checked out, then signs 
    it and deploys it to a provider.

  - `verify-all-releases`  
    Sequentially checks out each release of the current package and verifies the
    GPG signatures of all its dependencies.

  - `verify-current-release`  
    Verifies the GPG signatures of all dependences for whatever version of the 
    current package is checked out.

  - `list-unapproved-artifact-sigs`  
    Lists the name and GPG signature of each artifact dependency that is not on
    the Wren whitelist. The whitelist is located at
    http://wrensecurity.org/trustedkeys.properties.

  - `sign-3p-artifacts`  
    Generates GPG signatures for all unsigned third-party artifacts using the 
    Wren Security third-party key, then deploys the artifacts to a provider.

  - `sign-tools-jar`  
    Generates a GPG signature for the version of the JDK `tools.jar` currently 
    in use on the local machine using the Wren Security third-party key, then 
    deploys the artifact signature (not the JAR itself) to a provider.

`PROVIDER` can be either of the following:
  - `jfrog`
  - `bintray`

In addition, a `.wren-deploy.rc` file must exist in the current working
directory in order for the package in the current directory to be deployable. At
a minimum, the file must export the variable `MAVEN_PACKAGE`. It can optionally
export `MVN_COMPILE_ARGS` to modify the command line passed to Maven during 
compilation. Finally, it can also define the function 
`package_accept_release_tag()` in order to control which release tags are 
processed; if the function is not defined, all releases are processed, by
default.
